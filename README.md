# Decentralized Venture Debt Platform

## Overview

A community-funded venture debt platform providing growth capital to startups with revenue-based repayment structures and tokenized debt instruments for investors. This decentralized solution democratizes access to venture debt financing while offering transparent, liquid investment opportunities.

## Problem Statement

Traditional venture debt markets face significant barriers:
- **Limited Access**: Only well-connected startups can access Silicon Valley Bank-style lending

- **Concentration Risk**: Few specialized lenders creating systemic vulnerabilities

## Real-World Context

Silicon Valley Bank and Square 1 Bank provided $50B+ in venture debt before SVB's collapse, highlighting market fragility. Companies like Pipe and Lighter Capital pioneered revenue-based financing, while platforms like Republic enable retail startup investing, demonstrating growing demand for accessible venture capital markets.
